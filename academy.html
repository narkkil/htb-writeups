            <h2>2. Foothold</h2>

            <p>
                Sometimes HTB boxes will have HTTP servers configured only for <span>name.htb</span> style virtual
                hosts, so let's add the host to
                <span>/etc/hosts</span> first.

                <code>
    echo "10.10.10.125 dev-staging-01.academy.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
                </code>

                Running <span>nmap -sC -sV -T4 -v academy.htb</span> reveals two open TCP ports, 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).
            </p>
            <code>
    ...
    Not shown: 998 closed ports
    PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
    22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

    |_ Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
    |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)

    Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
    ...
            </code>

            <p> Opening the browser and pointing it to <span>http://academy.htb</span> will end up on a basic landing
                page with links to login and register. Looking at the register page source shows it has a hidden
                <span>roleid</span> field that is sent in the form data.
                Creating a user will allow us to login to the <span>academy.htb</span> site.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="static/img/academy_1.jpg">
                <figcaption>Web app front page after logging in</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                However, nothing seems to be working in this site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span>roleid</span> parameter will prove useful. Poking at the PHP application, it seems
                <span>admin.php</span> is a valid path and would point to an admin login (you may guess this since it's
                a typical configuration, although <span>gobuster dir -u http://academy.htb -w
                    /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x .php</span> will tell you just as
                much).
                The default seems to be <span>0</span>. Changing it to <span>1</span> in Burpsuite and trying to log in
                via
                <span>/admin.php</span> is successful and redirects to a different page.
            </p>
            <img src="static/img/academy_2.jpg">
            <figcaption>Modifying the POST request in Burp</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                This is a typical case where an application server will misplace trust in client supplied data, e.g.
                setting
                the user permission level from the client, something an unauthorized user should normally not be able to
                do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now let's visit the admin page.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="static/img/academy_3.jpg">
                <figcaption>Web app admin page after logging in</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Here, a subdomain of <span>academy.htb</span> is listed in a launch planner in the landing page after
            login. Let's add it to our hosts and visit.
            </p>

            <code>
    echo "10.10.10.125 dev-staging-01.academy.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
            </code>

            <p> Fortunately for us, the staging site runs into an error. Applications configured for staging still might
                be configured
                to display debug information. Modern web apps will in this case often display a stack trace of the error
                and optionally dump the application environment to help with debugging.
            </p>

            <p> By the looks of it the enviroment dump has some potentially useful information, for example the Laravel
                <span>APP_KEY</span>,
                <span>DB_USERNAME</span>, <span>DB_PASSWORD</span> and some information about other services running on
                the
                machine.
            </p>

            <p>A search for <span>laravel rce</span>
                might lead you to <a href="https://github.com/ravidhr/laravel_rce">this page</a> which looks useful if
                you know the Laravel <span>APP_KEY</span> environment variable. Looking further, it seems that
                Metasploit has this exploit implemented in
                <span>exploit/unix/http/laravel_token_unserialize_exec</span>. Configuring and running it will net a
                <span>www-data</span> shell at <span>/var/www/html/htb-academy-dev-01/public</span>.
            </p>

            <code>

            <p>Now let's upgrade our shell with <span>python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"</span> and start
                looking around.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="users">
            <h2>Obtaining users</h2>

            <span>cat /etc/passwd</span> tells us there are several regular users with login shells configured on this
            machine. A quick <span> cd /home && ls *</span> shows that <span>cry0l1t3</span> has the user flag. This
            user was also shown in the admin landing page after logging in.


            <section id="credentials">
                <h3>Searching for credentials</h3>


                <p>Looking around <span>/var/www/html</span> shows that it contains the <span>academy</span> application
                    data
                    as well as the staging application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span>/var/www/html/htb-academy-dev-01</span> directory contains a hidden <span>.env</span>
                    file, containing the staging application environment.
                    A <span>netstat -plunt</span> shows that there really is a MySQL server listening to the loopback
                    interface. However, the MySQL credentials obtained from the staging app do not work and it looks
                    like a
                    red herring.
                </p>

                <p> Fortunately, if you look around the <span>academy</span> application it also has an environment
                    file.
                    Here we find many of the same entries but with different values.

                <h3>First user</h3>
                Trying <span>mySup3rP4s5w0rd!!</span> to log in with all the users will eventually drop you a shell for
                <span>cry0l1t3</span>.
                We can then upgrade to a more stable SSH session without a key, since password logins are enabled
                (<span>cat
                    /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep Password</span> will confirm this).

                <span>/home/cry0l1t3</span> contains the user flag, which we promptly grab.

            <section id="second">
                <h3>Second user</h3>

                <span>cry0l1t3</span> doesn't have any <span>sudo</span> permissions, but belongs to a special group
                <span>adm</span>.
                It might
                be useful to
                check
                what
                files the <span>adm</span> group has access to, with the command <span>find / -group adm 2>/dev/null</span>.

                <span>/var/log/audit</span> seems to be in the results.

                <p>
                    Searching for this online may reveal that these are
                    generated by an audit log daemon called <span>aureport</span>. Since <span>cry0l1t3</span> can run
                    it,
                    we can look around. Particularly of interest is <span>aureport --tty</span>, which shows tty
                    keystroke
                    logs.
                </p>
